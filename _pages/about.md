I am a second year PhD student at the University of Chicago. I am interested in working on internet measurements and security. As a member of the Network Operations and Internet Security (NOISE) lab, I am being advised by [Prof. Nick Feamster](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/). I also contribute as a researcher to the [Internet Equity Initiative](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/).

I hold an MSc degree from the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Under the supervision of [Dr. Josiah Chavula](https://www.josiahchavula.com/), my MSc research focused towards understanding the state of internet in rural communities of South Africa. I built a real-time network monitoring and troubleshooting system for the [iNethi](https://www.inethi.org.za/) community network in Cape Town. Such an addition aims to equip researchers and network managers with an ability to execute and analyze on-demand network measurements.

In a past life, I was a software engineer in the Finance Technology industry. I worked for over a year in the Global Data Science team at [PayPal, Inc.](https://www.paypal.com), which was followed by a brief stint in a product development team at [ePayLater](https://www.epaylater.in).

I built this website as a side project to share my skills and experiences with the tech and academic community. Hope you like it!
