I am a second year PhD student at the University of Chicago. I am interested in working on internet measurements and security. As a member of the Network Operations and Internet Security (NOISE) lab, I am being advised by [Prof. Nick Feamster](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/). I also work as a researcher at the [Internet Equity Initiative](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/). Previously, I was at the University of Cape Town for my masters, where I worked with [Dr. Josiah Chavula](https://www.josiahchavula.com/).

In a past life, I was a software engineer in the Finance Technology industry. I worked for over a year in the Global Data Science team at [PayPal, Inc.](https://www.paypal.com), which was followed by a brief stint in a product development team at [ePayLater](https://www.epaylater.in).
